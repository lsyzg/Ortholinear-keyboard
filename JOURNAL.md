Began brainstorming ideas for how this keyboard should be formatted. First, it should be an ortholinear layout with an option for bluetooth or wired connection. Next, the keys should be kailh choc whites for a clicky feel. It should also be 60%.

Started layout with a ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 as the microcontroller, I modelled the keyswitch matrix with the switches and the diodes. Also began the charging circuit by adding a USB C port.

Next I need to add the actually charging circuit and assign footprints to each component
